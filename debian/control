Package: network-manager-gnome

Section: oldlibs
Depends: network-manager-applet (= ${binary:Version}),
         nm-connection-editor (= ${binary:Version}),
Description: transitional package for network-manager-applet and nm-connection-editor
 NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
 and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
 available. It manages ethernet, Wi-Fi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
 devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
 services.
 .
 This transitional package depends on network-manager-applet (shipping
 nm-applet which provides a notification area applet for controlling
 NetworkManager) and nm-connection-editor (a network connection configuration
 editor for NetworkManager).
 .
 It can be removed safely once no other package depends on it.
